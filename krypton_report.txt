5. Inside, found a file named `file` — used `cat` and `strings` to inspect contents
6. The file contained an encrypted string with a clear character pattern
7. Analyzed the pattern and discovered it uses a **monoalphabetic substitution cipher**
8. Used an online substitution cipher solver to decode it

Level: Krypton 3

Objective:
Log in with the Level 2 password and reverse-engineer the encryption used in a shell script to extract the password for Krypton Level 4.

Steps:
1. Connected to the server:
   ssh krypton3@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2222
2. Entered password from Level 2: ROFLmao123LOL
3. Found a file named `krypton4` containing a Bash script
4. Reviewed the script using `cat krypton4`
5. The script performs a character substitution based on a fixed key
   - It reads an input file and translates characters using a custom mapping
6. Wrote a Python script locally to reverse the character mapping and decode the encrypted password
7. Decryption revealed the password: mumBoJumB0123

Tools Used:
- SSH via Linux Terminal
- `cat` to read the script
- Python script for reversing substitution cipher

Password Found:
mumBoJumB0123

Conclusion:
Successfully reversed the character substitution logic from the script and retrieved the password for Krypton Level 4.


Level: Krypton 4

Objective:
Log in using the Level 3 password, analyze a C source file that encrypts the password using a Caesar cipher, and reverse it to find the password for Krypton Level 5.

Steps:
1. Connected via SSH:
   ssh krypton4@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2222
2. Entered the password from Level 3: mumBoJumB0123
3. Navigated into the `krypton5` directory and listed files
4. Found a file named `krypton5.c` and opened it using `cat`
5. The C program performs a Caesar cipher shift of **3 characters forward** on each letter
6. Reversed the Caesar cipher by shifting each letter **3 characters backward**
7. Used an online Caesar cipher decoder and input the encrypted string from the program
8. Decoded the password: caesARisalive321

Final walkthrough:
This report serves as the complete walkthrough for all Krypton levels. Each level includes the objective, steps taken, tools used, and passwords found through practical application and logical analysis.


Personal takeaways:
Through the Krypton wargame, I gained hands-on experience in basic cryptography, Linux commands, and reverse-engineering techniques. It helped me improve my problem-solving mindset and introduced me to different cipher types like ROT13, Caesar cipher, and monoalphabetic substitution. I also learned to analyze shell scripts and C code to extract hidden logic. This strengthened my confidence in handling real-world CTFs and security challenges.
